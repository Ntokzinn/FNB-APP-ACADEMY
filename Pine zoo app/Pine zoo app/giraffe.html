                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>                            
                <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals, known for their long necks and legs. They inhabit savannas and open woodlands in Africa, feeding primarily on leaves from tall trees. Their unique coat patterns help them blend into their environment, providing camouflage from predators.
                Giraffes are social animals, often found in loose herds. They communicate through a variety of vocalizations and body language. Their long necks allow them to reach high foliage, but they also use their powerful legs for defense against threats.
                Giraffes are herbivores, primarily eating leaves, flowers, and fruits. They have a specialized digestive system that allows them to extract nutrients from tough plant material. Giraffes are also known for their unique gait, moving both legs on one side of their body at the same time.
                Giraffes have a gestation period of about 15 months, after which a single calf is born. The calf is able to stand and walk shortly after birth, which is crucial for its survival in the wild. Giraffes are known for their gentle nature, but they can be aggressive when threatened.</p>
