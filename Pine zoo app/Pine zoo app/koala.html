                <h3>KOALA</h3> 
                <p>Koalas are marsupials native to Australia, known for their tree-dwelling lifestyle and diet primarily consisting of eucalyptus leaves. They have a distinctive appearance with large ears, a stout body, and a flat nose. Koalas are mostly nocturnal and spend most of their time sleeping in trees, which helps them conserve energy due to their low-nutrient diet.
                Koalas are social animals, often living in small groups called mobs. They communicate through a range of vocalizations, including grunts and bellows. Their population has been affected by habitat loss, bushfires, and disease, leading to conservation efforts to protect their natural habitats and ensure their survival.
                Koalas have a unique digestive system that allows them to break down the tough eucalyptus leaves they consume. They have a slow metabolism, which means they can sleep up to 20 hours a day to conserve energy. Their fur is thick and soft, providing insulation against temperature changes.
                Koalas are born underdeveloped and continue to grow in their mother's pouch for several months. After leaving the pouch, they remain dependent on their mother for food and protection for up to a year. Koalas have a strong sense of smell, which helps them locate suitable eucalyptus trees.
                Koalas are primarily found in the eucalyptus forests of eastern and southeastern Australia. They have a specialized diet that allows them to thrive in these environments, but they are vulnerable to changes in their habitat due to urbanization and climate change.
                Koalas are known for their gentle and docile nature, making them a popular symbol of Australian wildlife. They have a unique grooming behavior, using their strong claws to clean their fur and remove parasites. Koalas play a crucial role in their ecosystem by helping to maintain the health of eucalyptus forests.
                Koalas have a relatively low reproductive</p>
